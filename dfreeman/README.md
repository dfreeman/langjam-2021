Picture a 90s-style Under Construction gif here.

## TODO

Done

- [x] logging/native bindings

High priority

- [ ] clean up REPL visuals
- [ ] rich comment printing
- [ ] ADT instance printing
- [ ] comment linking
- [ ] example files/walkthrough
- [ ] error reporting in console
- [ ] `@expect` in examples

Lower priority

- [ ] arithemetic
- [ ] equality
- [ ] strings
- [ ] error reporting in source

Nice to have

- [ ] modules (nice for more interesting things to do with comments, but unnecessary)
- [ ] REPL history (I keep hitting <kbd>Up</kbd> and expecting it to do something)
